**LATEST TODO**
Please Clear your app data and reset your permissions after uploading your app.
For training select the required cell you need and press scan multiple times . (Currently we have three cells).
Repeat this for all the cells.
Later once you are done with the scans, Press WRITE JSON button. This button writes our JSON values to a test.json file internally.
Next step is to read our JSON so that our values are loaded. This step also includes generating the offline tables we need. The offline tables are stored in
pmf_data.json file
Next step is to localize. Now if you go to a particular cell and press localize, it should print which cell you are in.
